Swapi-Box displays Star Wars information fetched from the swapi API. The site was built using React. Depending on which button is selected, it will display cards for people, planets, or vehicles of the Star Wars universe. The data used for the displayed cards, is fetched on click from the API and stored in state thereafter. Each card has a 'favorite' button, allowing the user to select or unselect it to their favorites.
